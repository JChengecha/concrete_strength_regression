## Project Instructions: Building a Regression Model with Keras

### Objective
Building a **regression model** using the deep learning Keras library. Please note this is anot a complete project and only involve experimenting with:

- Increasing the number of training epochs.
- Changing the number of hidden layers.

The goal is to observe how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.

### Breakdown of Tasks

- **Part A: Build a baseline Model**
- **Part B: Using normalized the data**
- **Part C: Increase the number of epochs**
- **Part D: Increase the number of hidden layers**  

### Dataset
Model the same data about concrete compressive strength provided at the following link:
